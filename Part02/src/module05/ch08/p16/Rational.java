public class Rational {
    /*
    (Rational Numbers) Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to test
    your class. Use integer variables to represent the private instance variables of the class—the numerator and the
    denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it’s declared. The
    constructor should store the fraction in reduced form. The fraction 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2 and would be stored in
    the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator. Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in
    case no initializers are provided. Provide public methods that perform each of the following operations:

    Add two Rational numbers: The result of the addition should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.

    Subtract two Rational numbers: The result of the subtraction should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.

    Multiply two Rational numbers: The result of the multiplication should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.

    Divide two Rational numbers: The result of the division should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.

    Return a String representation of a Rational number in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator.

    Return a String representation of a Rational number in floating-point format.

    (Consider providing formatting capabilities that enable the user of the class to specify the number of digits of
    precision to the right of the decimal point.)
