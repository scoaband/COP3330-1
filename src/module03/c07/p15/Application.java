	 * (Total Sales) Use a two-dimensional array to solve the following problem: A
	 * company has four salespeople (1 to 4) who sell five different products (1 to
	 * 5). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each type of product
	 * sold. Each slip contains the following:
	 * 
	 * 1) The salesperson number
	 * 
	 * 2) The product number
	 * 
	 * 3) The total dollar value of that product sold that day
	 * 
	 * Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 5 sales slips per day. Assume
	 * that the information from all the slips for last month is available. Write an
	 * application that will read all this information for last monthâ€™s sales and
	 * summarize the total sales by salesperson and by product. All totals should be
	 * stored in the two-dimensional array `sales`. After processing all the
	 * information for last month, display the results in tabular format, with each
	 * column representing a salesperson and each row representing a particular
	 * product. Cross-total each row to get the total sales of each product for last
	 * month. Cross-total each column to get the total sales by salesperson for last
	 * month. Your output should include these cross-totals to the right of the
	 * totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
