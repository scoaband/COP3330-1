     * Calculate the integer part of the quotient when integer a is divided by
     * integer b.

     * Calculate the integer remainder when integer a is divided by integer b.

     * Use the methods developed in parts (a) and (b) to write a method
     * displayDigits that receives an integer between 1 and 99999 and displays it as
     * a sequence of digits, separating each pair of digits by two spaces. For
     * example, the integer 4562 should appear as
     * 
     * 4 5 6 2

     * displayDigits by passing the method the integer entered. Display the results.
