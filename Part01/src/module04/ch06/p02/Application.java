		// 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for longer than 24 hours
		// at a time. Write an application that calculates and displays the parking
		// charges for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday. You should

		// charge for the current customer and should calculate and display the running
		// total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to
		// determine the charge for each customer.
